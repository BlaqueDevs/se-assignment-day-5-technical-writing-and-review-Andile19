Why It Works: Action-oriented headings help readers focus on what needs to be done, improving usability and comprehension.
8. Use Consistent Formatting
Best Practice: Ensure that formatting (such as font size, bold, italics, or underlining) is consistent for headings and subheadings. Use bold for primary headings and italics or a smaller size for subheadings.
Why It Works: Consistent formatting helps visually differentiate between different levels of headings and makes the document look organized and professional.
Example:
H1: Introduction
H2: Overview of Technology
H3: Understanding the Basics
9. Make Them Engaging (But Not Overly Creative)
Best Practice: While headings should be clear and concise, they can also be engaging or interesting to draw the reader in. However, keep them professional, especially in technical contexts.
Why It Works: Engaging headings can make a document more approachable and encourage readers to keep reading, but too much creativity might detract from the document's clarity and professionalism.
10. Ensure Headings Are Self-Explanatory
Best Practice: Readers should be able to understand the topic of the section just by reading the heading. Avoid vague or overly general headings.
Why It Works: This ensures that readers don't have to guess or read through multiple paragraphs to figure out what the section is about.
11. Test Readability and Clarity
Best Practice: After creating headings and subheadings, take a step back and read them as a whole. Ensure they guide the reader through the content in a logical flow and that they are easy to understand.
Why It Works: This step ensures that your headings are effectively serving their purpose. If a heading feels unclear or awkward, rephrase it for better clarity.
12. Make Sure They Are Inclusive
Best Practice: Ensure that your headings and subheadings are inclusive and free of biased language.
Why It Works: Using inclusive language makes your document accessible and welcoming to a diverse audience.
